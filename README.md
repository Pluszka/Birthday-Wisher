Programm for sending emails.

To use that code you sholud make sure that you turn off securitty options at email addres which you want use for that. (let less secure apps allow acces)
In birtday.csv file I put emails which I created only for that project for testing it, so you have to change those, because you aren't going to see emails sent. Ofc you can change any data in that file except columns names.
my_email should equal to email you will have use, my_password simillar.
